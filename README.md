# ML-Case-PPT
You work as a junior data analyst for your organization, which we will assume for the purpose of this assignment is a relatively small nonprofit, under-resourced government agency, or a small business that operates in the public service space or is a contractor for public services.
New management arrived in the spring. Your new CEO/agency head is dead-set on bringing your organization into the 21st century and establishing a data strategy for your organization. The board of directors/legislators that your organization is accountable to has told the CEO that his or her job is dependent on delivering on this - finding ways to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness through the application of ML/AI tools.
The number of vendors and contractors out there selling AI/ML products and services is vast. Deloitte, Accenture, Guidehouse, PwC, and many other smaller consultancies and companies are eager for money in exchange for their expertise about how to build your organization's data strategy.
The CEO doesn't have a lot of technical skill - s/he is a subject matter expert (SME) and has a lot of managerial and bureaucratic skill, but s/he doesn't have time to develop a lot of technical wherewithal. S/he knows enough to know that if s/he goes into meetings with these vendors and doesn't have some basic understanding of AI/ML, she is going to get bamboozled and won't know how to make good decisions.
You are going to serve as your CEO's right-hand person in future meetings with AI/ML consultancies.
You've completed the class. Now, the CEO wants an executive summary of what you've learned.
Prepare a 12-15 minute presentation and slide deck that summarizes what you think are the most important lessons that you learned in this class.. You can record in Panopto or by another screen capture method.
Your manager wants to you to:
(1) Briefly introduce yourself and describe the organization for which you work (if you wish, you can assume a new or aspirational identity, role, and organization for this exercise).
(2) Define machine learning.
(3) Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning.
(4) Describe 2 simple examples of machine learning that illustrate regression and classification (please, no examples straight from ISL).
(5) Compare and contrast 4 different methods of regression/classification and describe why you would choose one instead of the other.
(6) Explain, to a layperson, how deep learning is different from the other methods presented in the course and why this class of tools is so "hot" right now.
(7) Describe the next steps, additional training, and resources you need to further develop as the machine learning/artificial intelligence technical lead in your organization.
------------------------------------------
Below is a Python code outline for a presentation script that summarizes the key concepts of AI/ML, which you can use to prepare an executive summary for your CEO. This code is structured as a text output that summarizes the lessons learned in the class. In this case, the goal is to create a cohesive and easy-to-understand executive summary. You would present this as a slide deck, but the following script covers all the points required for a 12-15 minute presentation.
Python Code for the Presentation Script:

# Assuming your role as a junior data analyst, working for a small nonprofit
presentation = Presentation(name="John Doe", organization="Nonprofit AI Integration", position="Junior Data Analyst")
presentation.generate_presentation()

Explanation of Code:

    Class-based Structure: The presentation script is structured in a class (Presentation) that contains methods for each part of the presentation.
    Methods for Content: Each key point of the presentation (introduction, ML definition, supervised vs unsupervised learning, examples, regression methods, deep learning, next steps) is stored as a method in the class. These methods contain simple explanations or examples that will be printed when the presentation is generated.
    Generate Presentation: The generate_presentation method assembles all parts of the presentation and outputs them in a sequential manner.

Output:

This script would output a textual explanation for each of the major concepts in the presentation. If you need to present this in a visual format, you can manually create slides with the content that is printed by the Python script.
Sample Output:

Hello, my name is John Doe. I work as a Junior Data Analyst at Nonprofit AI Integration. As part of the nonprofit/agency sector, our organization is working towards incorporating AI/ML strategies into our operations to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and better serve the public.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **What is Machine Learning?**
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML models use algorithms to analyze patterns in data and improve their performance over time.
--------------------------------------------------
2. **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**
In **Supervised Learning**, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning it learns from data that includes both the input and the correct output (label). Examples include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values).

In **Unsupervised Learning**, the model is given data without labels and must identify patterns, groupings, or structures within the data itself. Common examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
--------------------------------------------------
3. **Examples of Machine Learning**
Example 1: **Regression** - Predicting housing prices based on features like square footage, location, and the number of rooms. This is a continuous outcome, and a linear regression model might be used to make predictions.

Example 2: **Classification** - Identifying whether an email is spam or not based on its content. This is a discrete outcome, and a decision tree or logistic regression might be used for this classification task.
--------------------------------------------------
4. **Comparing Regression/Classification Methods**
1. **Linear Regression**: Best used when there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It's simple and interpretable.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems, such as spam detection, where the output is either 0 or 1.
3. **Decision Trees**: Great for both classification and regression tasks. They are interpretable but can overfit the data.
4. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method based on decision trees that helps to reduce overfitting by averaging multiple trees.

When deciding which method to use, consider the following:
1. If you have a linear relationship, **Linear Regression** is simple and effective.
2. If you're dealing with a binary outcome, consider **Logistic Regression**.
3. For interpretable models that work well with both regression and classification, go for **Decision Trees**.
4. To handle overfitting and improve accuracy, use **Random Forest** or ensemble methods.
--------------------------------------------------
5. **Deep Learning Explained**
**Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers (hence the 'deep'). These networks are able to automatically learn features from raw data (e.g., images, text) and improve performance on tasks such as image recognition or natural language processing.

Deep learning models require a large amount of data to be effective and computationally intensive resources for training. They are gaining popularity because they can handle complex data and tasks more effectively than traditional machine learning methods.
--------------------------------------------------
6. **Next Steps and Additional Training**
The next steps to becoming a technical lead in AI/ML include:
1. **Advanced Training**: Explore online courses in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing to stay updated with new trends.
2. **Hands-On Experience**: Practice working on real-world datasets, creating models, and fine-tuning them for better accuracy.
3. **Collaboration with Experts**: Build relationships with data scientists, ML engineers, and AI specialists to better understand the practical applications of these techniques in our organization.
4. **Staying Informed**: Follow relevant research papers, AI/ML blogs, and conferences to stay up-to-date with the evolving field of artificial intelligence.

This script will help you create a clear and structured executive summary that your CEO can use to prepare for vendor meetings about AI/ML.
